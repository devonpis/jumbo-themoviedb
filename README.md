Jumbo Front-end Developer Code Project
[github](https://github.com/devonpis/jumbo-themoviedb)
[Demo](https://jumbo-themoviedb.web.app/)

### Acceptence criteria

- It must use the TMDB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
- It must display a list of popular media (TV or Movies),
- It must link each entity to its own details page and display relevant information
- It must maintain browser history when navigating between views
- It must match the provided mocks
- It should allow the user to search for a specific movie (not limited to popular movies)
- It should use JS as the primary language (preferably React although not required)
- It may be responsive to desktop and mobile clients (libertyâ€™s may be taken for alternate viewport sizes)

### Remarks

- I've utilised the data store in this project, search results are cached in the store unless the user start a new search, refresh the browser or leaving the site.
- Same apply to the movie details page, movie info is cached in the store unless the user start a new search, refresh the browser or leaving the site.
- As I'm running out of time, unit testing is still WIP, and i havn't clean up unneccessary files in the boilerplate.
